## ⚠️ A Note on `System.out.println()`

Using `System.out.println()` directly in code is considered an **anti-pattern** in professional software development:

- ❌ It mixes business logic with output
- ❌ It doesn't support log levels or filtering
- ❌ It clutters the codebase and console

🧪 In this test project, `System.out.println()` was used to:

- Visualize how the code flows
- Show what the application "does" at each step
- Provide immediate feedback without setting up a logging system

✅ In real-world applications, proper logging libraries (like SLF4J + Logback) should always be used instead.
